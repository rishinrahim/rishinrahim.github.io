Starting the year with a thoughtful upgrade.

I decided it was time to level up my tech game and what better way to start than by upgrading my trusty old [laptop](https://support.apple.com/en-la/111924)? I initially thought a MacBook Air, a natural upgrade, would be a good choice, but after reading reviews about the Mac Mini, my decision was clear. I ordered a new Mac Mini at the tail end of last year and received it in the second week of January. Since then, I have been exploring various Mac setup articles and videos to optimize my system. In this article, I will list all the apps and modifications I made on my new Mac Mini and include references at the end.## Mac mini specification

	- Homebrew installs [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ "List of Homebrew packages") that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t. “To install, drag this icon…” no more. 
	- [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) installs macOS apps, fonts and plugins and other non-open source software.

    ```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    ```
