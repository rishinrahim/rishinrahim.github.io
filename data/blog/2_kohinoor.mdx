A fascinating book that traces the path of one of History’s most enigmatic artifact- The Koh-i-noor. This historical non fiction book is so well researched and comprehensive that the notes and citations alone occupies more than 20 pages, which is a delight in itself.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part, written by _William Dalrymple_, captures Kohinoor’s early history. From the references in Hindu Puranas to possible medieval sightings, the early modern sightings during the Mughal times, the violent seizure by Nader shah, till the ownership is transferred over to the Sikhs via Afghanistan, we get a glimpse of the degree of greed, murder, torture, conquest and treachery involved, when the stone was passed from one regimen to another. We get a picture of the opulence and splendour of those times, the art and aesthetics of the people, the sheer extravaganza and excessive obsession of the rulers towards allegory and symbols. We see how Kohinoor slowly evolves from one of the three legendary gems to the sole and singular symbol of sovereignty and power.

The second part, written by _Anita Anand_, provides an in-depth analysis of the strongly contentious transfer of ownership from the Punjab dynasty to the British Monarch. It highlights the inner politics, strategies and ambition that the British showcased to capture the precious stone and at the same time, we get a glimpse of the history of the mighty Punjab dynasty, its decline and the tragic fate of young Maharajah Duleep Singh. The book ends with the different futile attempts made by its numerous hosts to bring back the stone.

This book is a crash course of Indian history from late medieval to early modern and is filled with facts and information. The sheer drama involved can eclipse some of the most thrilling fiction and the authors deserve a big appreciation for presenting history in such an intriguing and impartial manner. A brilliant book and thoroughly enjoyable read.
