Starting the year with a thoughtful upgrade, I decided it was time to level up my tech game—and what better way to start than by upgrading my trust old [laptop](https://support.apple.com/en-la/111924)? I initially thought a MacBook Air, a natural upgrade, would be a good choice, but after reading reviews about the Mac Mini, my decision was clear. I ordered a new Mac Mini at the tail end of last year and received it in the second week of January. Since then, I have been exploring various Mac setup articles and videos to optimize my system. In this article, I will list all the apps and modifications I made on my new Mac Mini and include references at the end.
