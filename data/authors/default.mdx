Rishin Rahim is a Senior Machine Learning engineer, currently working @ Walmart. He helps to bring ML models into production and is deeply interested in LLMs, Graph Neural Networks, PyTorch, and Deep Learning at scale.

Rishin has a complicated relationship with books—he loves them but often wishes he read more consistently.
His favorite genres are science fiction and historical non-fiction, and he’s particularly drawn to authors like
 Khaled Hosseini, Basheer, Andy Weir, William Dalrymple, and Michael Crichton.
A long-time admirer of the Harry Potter series, he fondly remembers his teenage years as a proud Potterhead.
Lately, he’s been diving into the classics of science fiction, exploring the genre’s best.
You can find all his thoughts and reviews linked here.

In sports, his passion burns bright, especially for football and cricket. A die-hard fan of Argentina 🇦🇷 NT(yes, Messi is the 🐐), his teenage years saw him cheering for Manchester United before switching allegiance to Barcelona—
a natural progression for a Messi admirer. While his friends might call changing clubs sacrilege, Rishin shrugs it off with a grin. "Blasphemy? Nah, just evolution," he quips.😜

A hardcore movie buff, Rishin watches films not just for enjoyment but to dissect them. He admires directors like David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Denis Villeneuve,
 Michael Mann, Paul Greengrass, Sathyan Anthikkad, Siddique-Lal, and Dileesh Pothan. On the TV front, he devours TV series with an insatiable appetite. Some of his favorites include Breaking Bad,
The Wire, Game of Thrones, The Office, Stranger Things, Friends, Westworld (Season 1), True Detective (Season 1), Unbelievable, House M.D., Better Call Saul, The Watchmen, and The Boys.

When it comes to music, Rishin is one of the biggest fans of A.R. Rahman. In fact, he built a Rahman jukebox as a mini project during his college days. He leans heavily toward regional
musicians but also enjoys global acts such as Metallica, Muse, System of a Down, Coldplay, Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson, Ludovico Einaudi, and Max Richter

Rishin lives in Bangalore with his wife Jyobna, who shares his love for the Harry Potter universe, and their two beagles 🐕, Skylar  and Tyson. They enjoy a laid-back, fulfilling life together.
