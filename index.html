              As a Sr. Machine Learning engineer at <a href="https://www.blueoptima.com//">Blueoptima</a>,I currently lead the development of machine learning models 
              capable of detecting AI generated code, assessing the impact of AI on developer productivity and quality.
              We are also working on building a model that can identify developer signatures within code, that significantly aids in authorship.
              We are also working on Fine-tuning state-of-the-art code generation LLM models such as Code Llama and Mistral to address code vulnerabilities.
              These models, fine-tuned on datasets featuring code vulnerabilities, significantly improved the accuracy of automated code repair techniques.
              Previously, I contributed to the development of models capable of discerning developer behaviour based on version control data and commit 
              patterns.
              I also worked on the development of a model to map OSS dependency vulnerabilities to published vulnerabilities in NVD by analysing
              text data from JIRA Bug reports, Github issues, release notes, and security advisories.
              My role also extends to managing and maintaining the end-to-end deployment of these models into the production environment.
              Our development/production environment is set up on an on-premise cloud, integrated with CUDA GPUs, using Kubernetes, MLflow, and Docker.

          I was a Sr. Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.unisys.com/">Unisys</a>. At Unisys, I played a pivotal role in the development of IntelliServe, a conversational AI tool where we built models to identify the intent of a conversation, triage them to respective handlers and built utterance models to generate conversations using Knowledge graphs to create synthetic training data. I also contributed significantly to CloudForte where I developed time series forecasting models, leading to significant resource optimization in cloud environments. Also developed recommendation models aiding users in making informed decisions about upscaling or downscaling of resources. All development activities were done within the Databricks ecosystem, and the models were deployed in the Azure cloud.

          I Joined TCS right after college as a Junior ML Engineer. I was part of the TCS Robotics unit. During my tenure, I actively participated in numerous projects and proof-of-concepts (POCs). Two noteworthy projects are Contract Digitization and SmartQE. In Contract Digitisation, an AI platform for Legal Documents, I designed and implemented a robust pipeline for collecting, storing, cleaning, and transforming legal documents. I also developed models for extracting standard agreement/contract clauses using various NLP techniques. For SmartQE, a test suite optimization model, I significantly enhanced test coverage and reduced redundancy. I created a Defect Prediction model to forecast the number of defects in future application releases. Additionally, I developed a Comparison model to measure the degree of similarity between different test step executions.

It was in my masterâ€™s program that I got interested in ML. My masters thesis was titled <i>Threshold logic Object Detection using FPGAs </i> where we proposed 2 novel techniques for object detection using FPGAs. The design and verification was done using Verilog HDL. The design is then synthesised and mapped into FPGA. Thesis Advisor: Dr. Alex P James.
