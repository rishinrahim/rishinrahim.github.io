        Some of the sci-fi I've read, sorted by the product of (recommended * obscure), descending. You'll notice a few trends:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>I like hard sci-fi and read for intriguing technical ideas, world-building, and future forecasting.</li>
          <li>I do not like flowery descriptions of the scenary, the details of someone's brow, or other related literary bloat.</li>
          <li>I cannot stand unimaginative aliens who are humanoid, have faces, speak by sound, etc., unless panspermia is invoked.</li>
          <li>I especially enjoy sci-fi that features Artificial Intelligence. I believe AI is the greatest omission from most sci-fi worlds.</li>
        </ul>

          <span class="book-text">VR Metaverse. Super nerdy. Down with corpo. Highly enjoyable. Total page turner.</span>

          <span class="book-text">An alien microscopic organism makes first contact with humans and it ain't pretty. A bio-heavy hard sci-fi all the way from 1969, an era that was otherwise decidedly all about space.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="book">
          <span class="book-title">Dragon's Egg</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Robert Forward, 1980</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Liu Cixin, 2006</span>
          <span class="book-text">Several fantastic diamonds of novel ideas sprinkled about, but mixed in with a large mass of goo, soulless characters, narrative/logical inconsistencies, poor choices of what to expand on and what to omit, and a really disappointing conclusion.</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Isaac Asimov, 1950</span>
          <span class="book-text">Early robot short stories. Read it a very long time ago but only medium enjoyed, would like to re-read.</span>

          <span class="book-title">A Fire Upon The Deep</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Vernor Vinge, 1992</span>
          <span class="book-text">Incredible first chapter, bit downhill from there. Disliked everything about the Tine race of sentient ... dogs?</span>

          <span class="book-title">Foundation</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Isaac Asimov, 1951</span>
          <span class="book-text">Incredible first chapters and macro world building. Love the concept of psychohistory and story arch. Disliked the societies that are indistinguishable from 1950s as they quabble with each other and smoke tabacco.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="book">
          <span class="book-title">Childhood's End</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Arthur C. Clarke, 1953</span>
          <span class="book-text">Alien contact sci-fi. Independence Day but friendly. With a twist. Humanoid aliens who speak English and have faces not super my cup of tea.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="book">
          <span class="book-title">Flowers for Algernon</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Daniel Keyes, 1959</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Iain M. Banks, 1996</span>
          <span class="book-text">Read a very long time ago, remember really enjoying select parts having to do with a highly mysterious superintelligence. Note to re-read.</span>

          <span class="book-title">Solaris</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by Stanislaw Lem, 1961</span>
          <span class="book-text">Another genuinly interesting treatment of an interesting alien from Lem. A little too frustrating/tedious to read in all other aspects.</span>

          <span class="book-title">1984</span>
          <span class="book-detail">by George Orwell, 1949</span>
          <span class="book-text">A bit too much of a caricature but very enjoyable. A little too real. Newspeak.</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Adrian Tchaikovsky, 2015</span>
          <span class="book-text">Interesting alien civilization premise, a little too long. Loved the idea of a "classicist".</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Robert A. Heinlein, 1966</span>
          <span class="book-text">Made it about halfway then lost interest. Some interesting ideas (rock throwing), but implausible AI, imo. Note to give another shot later.</span>

          <span class="book-detail">by Orson Scott Card, 1985</span>
          <span class="book-text">A bit like Harry Potter in space, but less fun and inventive. Fun twist at the end.</span>

          <span class="book-text">At one point there were some alien females wearing jewels and I just couldn't continue. A good example of sci-fi where my taste departs from popular taste. I simply cannot tolerate or accept antropomorphic aliens, it makes me angry.</span>
