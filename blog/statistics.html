      <h1>30 Days of Statistics</h1>
      <hr>

      <h3>Day 1: Basics of Measurement</h3>
      <p>June 1, 2021</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to objects to facilitate the use of mathematics.</li>
      <li><b>Levels of Measurement</b>: Nominal and Ordinal data, Interval and Ratio Data, Continuous and discrete Data</li>
      <li><b>Operationalization :</b>The process of specifying how a concept will be defined and measured.
        For example, intelligence has no definite metric; instead, we use IQ score to measure intelligence.
        Other examples include disaster preparedness, quality of life, pain, etc.
      </li>
      <li><b>Proxy Measurement :</b>The process of substituting one measurement with another.</li>
      <li><b>Errors :</b>Reducible errors / systemic errors and Irreducible errors / random errors</li>
      <li><b>Evaluation of Methods of Measurement :</b>Reducible errors / systemic errors and Irreducible errors / random errors</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Day 2: Evaluation of Methods of measurement</h3>
      <p>June 2, 2021</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to objects to facilitate the use of mathematics.</li>
      <li><b>Reliability</b>:How consistent or repeated measurements are.
        Many measures of reliability draw on the correlation coefficient.
        Three primary approaches: multiple occasion reliability, multiple forms reliability, and internal consistency.
      </li>
      <li><b>Validity :</b>Multiple form: How similarly different versions of testing perform in measuring the same entity.
        Multiple form: How similarly different versions of testing perform in measuring the same entity.
        Internal consistency: How well the items that make up an instrument reflect the same construct.
      </li>
      <li><b>Triangulation :</b>The process of combining different information
         from different sources to arrive at a true or, at least, most accurate value. For example, 
         Multi-method matrix (MTMM)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Day 3: Method of Central Tendency</h3>
      <p>June 3, 2021</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Among the first statistics computed for the continuous variables in a new dataset. These measures indicate where most values in a distribution fall .</li>
        <li>The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, the median, and the mode. One’s choice of mean, median, or mode can dramatically change the interpretation of the data.</li>
        <li>The mean is the arithmetic average (the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores). While the mean is the most common measure of a dataset’s center, there are situations when it cannot be used.</li>
        <li>Mean is not an appropriate summary measure for every dataset because it is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), so can be misleading for Skewed data.</li>
        <li>Trimmed Mean also known as Winsorized Mean is calculated by discarding certain percentage of extreme values in a distribution and calculating mean of the remaining values.</li>
        <li>When the data are nominal (i.e., when the data are categories rather than values), you must use the mode (Most frequently occurring value) to summarize the center</li>
        <li>Median is the best option when data are ordinal. The median of a distribution of scores is the value at the 50th percentile, which means that half of the scores are below this value and half are above it.</li>
        <li>To summarize interval or ratio data, in general, you should use the mean. however, if the data set contains one or more outliers, you should use the median.</li>
        <li>If mean and median are close to each other, and the most common ranges cluster around the mean , then we can conclude that data is Normal and Symmetrical</li>
        <li>A mean lower than the median is typical of left-skewed data because the extreme lower values pull the mean down, whereas they do not have the same effect on the median</li>
        <li>A mean higher than a median is common for right-skewed data because the extreme higher values pull the mean up but do not have the same effect on the median.</li>

      </ul>
