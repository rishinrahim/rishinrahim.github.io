        This list comprises the books I've read, each accompanied by a brief review. While I may not consider myself an avid reader, I am keenly interested in delving into books whenever
         I find some spare time. My goal is to expand the number of books I've read and enhance the comprehensiveness of this list.</div>

        <span class="book-title">Project Hail Mary</span>
        <span class="book-detail">by Andy Weir, 2021</span>
        <span class="book-text">I liked Project Hail Mary and is enjoyable with its 'Science the shit out of a problem' approach which the author previously used in The Martian. Great premise neatly  balancing nerdiness and quirkiness.
          What I had an issue with was the characterization of the protagonist and wished the book handled certain aspects with a touch more nuance. Enjoyable but not thought provoking.</span>

        <span class="book-title">Lost in the Jungle</span>
        <span class="book-detail">by Yossi Ghinsberg, 1985</span>
        <span class="book-text"> Lost in the Jungle is an adventure survival story about how a group of friends or acquaintances decided to spend some time in the Amazon Rainforest but unfortunately they gets lost in the jungle and experiences some harrowing and near death events. This story is narrated by one of the friends, Yossi, who spends about eighteen days alone in the jungle.The writing was very basic and sometimes I wished the writing was more detailed. This could may be due to the fact that the original was written in Hebrew and later translated. May be a lot of detailing might have been lost in the translation. Anyway, despite the lack of richness from a literary point of view, still the book was a real page turner.I love survival adventure books or stories, mainly because of the edge of the seat thrilling moments that it evokes in me. The survival instincts of human beings always enthralled me. Although thinking about such situations is very scary, I always wished I could also experience the things like in the books.  Experience of reading such book will be always remembered as a vivid, thrilling part of our life.I would confidently put this book in that category because some of the experiences that the author faces is fascinating as well as downright scary. Some of the decisions that they make is very puzzling and seems idiotic but still the courage they showed and the will power to not give up hope is encouraging and touching. The character changes that the author undergoes, from a brazen arrogant youth who lacks any kind of awareness regarding the jungle and very insensitive to its living beings to a person who is trying to find redemption for his actions by fighting for the rights and existence of the same jungle and its tribes and their upliftment is commendable.All in all, the book was thoroughly enjoyable.</span>

        <span class="book-title">Kohinoor: The Story of the World’s Most Infamous Diamond</span>
        <span class="book-detail">by William Dalrymple, 2016</span>
        <span class="book-text">A fascinating book that traces the path of one of History’s most enigmatic artefact- The Koh-i-noor. This historical non fiction book is so well researched and comprehensive that the notes and citations alone occupies more than 20 pages, which is a delight in itself.The book is divided into two parts. The first part, written by Dalrymple, captures Kohinoor’s early history. From the references in Hindu Puranas to possible medieval sightings, the early modern sightings during the Mughal times, the violent seizure by Nader shah, till the ownership is transferred over to the Sikhs via Afghanistan, we get a glimpse of the degree of greed, murder, torture, conquest and treachery involved, when the stone was passed from one regimen to another. We get a picture of the opulence and splendour of those times, the art and aesthetics of the people, the sheer extravaganza and excessive obsession of the rulers towards allegory and symbols. We see how Kohinoor slowly evolves from one of the three legendary gems to the sole and singular symbol of sovereignty and power.The second part, written by Anita Anand, provides an in-depth analysis of the strongly contentious transfer of ownership from the Punjab dynasty to the British Monarch. It highlights the inner politics, strategies and ambition that the British showcased to capture the precious stone and at the same time, we get a glimpse of the history of the mighty Punjab dynasty, its decline and the tragic fate of young Maharajah Duleep Singh. The book ends with the different futile attempts made by its numerous hosts to bring back the stone.This book is a crash course of Indian history from late medieval to early modern and is filled with facts and information. The sheer drama involved can eclipse some of the most thrilling fiction and the authors deserve a big appreciation for presenting history in such an intriguing and impartial manner. A brilliant book and thoroughly enjoyable read.</span>

        <span class="book-title">The White Tiger</span>
        <span class="book-detail">by Aravind Adiga, 2008</span>
        <span class="book-text">Winner of the Man Booker Prize 2008, White tiger is a breezy read filled with dark humour and hard hitting criticism of India. The author gives a bleak picture of a morally corrupt and dangerously volatile caste struggles. The book may seem filled with exaggerated India-bashing told through a Bollywoodish tale of rags to riches, but no honest reader would deny the fact that the things narrated in the book are not only possible but happens very often in most part of the country, especially the caste struggles.Through his protagonist Balram, the Author tries to give a picture of the never ending war between the powerful and the powerless, the struggles and humiliations faced by the poor and the lower castes that we hear everyday in the news. The author uses lots of symbols and metaphors to support his narrative. One such metaphor, the Rooster coop is used for describing the oppression of India’s poor. Roosters in a coop at the market watch one another slaughtered one by one, but are unable or unwilling to rebel and break out of the coop. Similarly, India’s poor people see one another crushed by the wealthy and powerful, defeated by the staggering inequality of Indian society, but are unable to escape the same fate.Despite all the wit and brutal cynicism, as a native Indian, the voice of Balram lacked a bit of genuineness although the scenarios were very real. The critics and cynicism were apt at a macro level but when you go deeper into the character, there was a definite lack of authenticity. Author, at times, was so out of touch with his own creation, like a tourist watching sympathetically at the poor state of the country and ranting about it to his people back home. Moreover, the whole story is written like a letter to the Chinese supreme, which I felt very needless and gimmicky.It is definitely funny and an enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend it for its remorseless and delightfully mordant wit but is it worthy of such a prestigious award. I don’t think so, The book is shallow, caricaturish and gimmicky, and does not contribute anything as a social/political novel. From a literary perspective, I felt disappointed with this book</span>

        <span class="book-title">The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</span>
        <span class="book-detail">by Arundhati Roy, 2017</span>
        <span class="book-text">A short summary of everything happening in contemporary India. Beautiful in many places but not an easy read and requires a lot of patience.There is the plight of hijra community, discrimination faced by Dalits, Anna Hazare movements, the rising Hindu fanaticism, maoism and ofcourse Kashmir. Sometimes feel like the author has pulled out too many issues with some lacking serious depth. We feel like reading through a non fiction book sprinkled with some fictitious characters. And in many cases, it is hard to decipher whether a character is fiction or real, falling into the trap of googling the tale behind a 'fact'.The first few chapters were unputdownable when the story focussed on the life of Anjum - a hijra. There was so much heart in her story. But her tale was soon paused and the narrative completely transferred to the world of Tilo and the ever serene but mourning Kashmir. Tilo, an extension of the author herself, is an interesting character but fail to attract any emotional attachment. More than the characters, it is the story of Kashmir as a whole that captivates the readers with its tale of martyrdoms, mournings and the unconsoled (to whom the book is dedicated). We see Kashmir and its issues through the lens of its people and how deeply it has affected different generations. We fear for the generation that the mainland has constructed, a generation that has known nothing but war.We see the rising 'stupidification' of the mainland and impending danger that it brings.Into the midst of all this sadness comes the baby miss Jebeen the second, with a maoist past, who spreads happiness to the people in Jannat guest house, a place where hope and grief are beautifully woven together by the people who have endured suffering and discriminations in their own way.Things turn out all right in the end. Arundhati Roy is a brave author and this book is all about her experiences of being an activist, a vocal resistance against the exploitation of the weak and the voiceless. For people who holds an extremely different political stand, the book will be like a blasphemous and irrational creation. But for me, it was deeply powerful and moving, at least in some places.</span>
